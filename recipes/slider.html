    <ul>
        <li>1 pound bacon</li>
        <li>12 hawaiian rolls</li>
        <li>1/4 cup softened butter</li>
        <li>1/4 cup brown sugar</li>
        <li>1/8 teaspoon cayenne pepper</li>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>1/3 cup half-and-half</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1/4 cup teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon maple syrup</li>
        <li>confectioner's sugar</li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil, and lay bacon strips in a single layer on the sheet.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until browned and crisp, about 15 minutes. Drain bacon slices on paper towels.</li>
        <li>Reduce the oven temperature to 325 degrees F (160 degrees C). Slice rolls in half lengthwise. Spread 2 tablespoons butter over the cut side of bottom half of rolls. Top evenly with brown sugar and cayenne pepper. Arrange bacon slices over brown sugar mixture.</li>
        <li>Spread 1 tablespoon butter evenly into the bottom of a 9x13-inch casserole dish. Place the prepared sandwich half in the buttered pan.</li>
        <li>Whisk eggs, half-and-half, vanilla, salt, and syrup together in a separate 9x13-inch baking dish. Add top half of rolls to egg mixture and turn a couple times to coat and lightly soak the bread. Allow the excess egg mixture to drip off and place top half of rolls over bacon layer. Cover with foil. Discard any excess egg mixture.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Uncover and bake until golden brown and lightly toasted, 5 to 10 minutes more.</li>
        <li>Spread remaining butter over the tops. Cut into 12 servings. Dust with confectioner's sugar. Serve with syrup for dipping.</li>
    </ol>
